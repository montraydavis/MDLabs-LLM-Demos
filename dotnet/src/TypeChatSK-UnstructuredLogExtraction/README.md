# 🚀 TypeChat.NET Log Extraction Wizard 🧙‍♂️

Welcome to the magical world of log extraction using Microsoft's TypeChat.NET library! 🎩✨

## 🌟 What's This All About?

This project harnesses the power of AI 🤖 to transform your messy, unstructured logs into beautiful, structured data. It's like turning a pumpkin into a carriage, but for your logs! 🎃➡️🏰

### 🔍 The Problem We're Solving

Logs are the unsung heroes of our digital world. They hold valuable insights, but they're often buried in a mountain of unstructured text. It's like trying to find a needle in a haystack... while blindfolded... on a unicycle. 🦄🕵️‍♀️

### 💡 Our Solution

Enter TypeChat.NET! We've created a log extraction wizard that can:

- 📊 Parse unstructured logs
- 🧠 Understand the context
- 🏗️ Extract structured data
- 🎭 Categorize log entries
- 🚦 Identify status codes and HTTP methods
- 🕰️ Extract timestamps
- 🔗 Link related log entries

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. We define a schema for our structured logs using C# classes.
2. We feed unstructured logs to our AI model.
3. The AI, guided by our schema, extracts the relevant information.
4. Voila! Structured logs appear as if by magic! 🎩🐰

## 🌈 Benefits
