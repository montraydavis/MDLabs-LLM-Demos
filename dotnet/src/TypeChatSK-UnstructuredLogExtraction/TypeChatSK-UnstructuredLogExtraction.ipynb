    "# 🎭 The IInputHandler Interface: Our Magical Translator\n",
    "\n",
    "In the realm of log extraction, we need a special kind of wizard - one who can understand and process the incantations (inputs) of mere mortals. Enter the `IInputHandler` interface, our magical translator!\n",
    "\n",
    "```csharp\n",
    "/// <summary>\n",
    "/// An input processor is a target for natural language input from the user\n",

    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's unravel the mysteries of this magical interface:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 📜 **Interface Definition**: `IInputHandler` is like a contract for our magical translators. Any class that implements this interface promises to have the power to process user inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. 🧙‍♂️ **ProcessInputAsync Method**: This is where the real magic happens! \n",
    "   - It takes two parameters:\n",
    "     - `string input`: The user's incantation (their input) that needs to be processed.\n",
    "     - `CancellationToken cancelToken`: A magical stop sign that can interrupt our spell if needed.\n",
    "   - It returns a `Task<string>`: A promise of a response, allowing our magic to happen asynchronously.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. 🌟 **Asynchronous Magic**: The `async` nature of this method means our wizard can multitask, processing inputs without freezing the entire magical realm (our application).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. 🔮 **Flexibility**: This interface allows us to create different types of input handlers. Maybe one for logs, another for queries, and so on. They'll all follow the same magical pattern!\n",
    "\n",
    "By implementing this interface, we're creating a standardized way to process user inputs in our log extraction journey. It's like having a universal translator for all sorts of magical requests!\n",

    "\n",
    "In the grand quest of log extraction, even the mightiest wizards need a reliable spellbook. Enter the `PromptLibrary` class - our collection of common incantations to guide our AI familiar!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's decode this mystical tome:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 📜 **Purpose**: This class serves as a centralized repository for our commonly used prompts and instructions. It's like having a well-organized spellbook at our fingertips!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. 🧙‍♂️ **Static Magic**: The `Instructions()` method is static, meaning we can call upon its wisdom without creating an instance of the `PromptLibrary` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. 🗣️ **The Incantation**: Our primary spell for this quest is simple yet powerful:\n",
    "   ```csharp\n",
    "   \"Extract each log entry from the provided unstructured logs.\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This clear instruction guides our AI familiar in its task of transforming chaos into order.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. 🧩 **PromptSection**: We wrap our instruction in a `PromptSection`, a special construct that helps organize our prompts for the AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. 🔮 **Extensibility**: While we currently have only one method, this class is primed for expansion. We can easily add more specialized instructions for different types of log extraction tasks in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `PromptLibrary` is our go-to grimoire for consistent, reusable instructions. By centralizing our prompts here, we ensure that our log extraction spells remain consistent across different parts of our magical application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, young sorcerer, clear and consistent instructions are the key to reliable magic. Use this `PromptLibrary` to keep your AI familiar well-guided and your log extraction results consistent! 📚✨"

    "# 🧙‍♂️ LogExtractionApp: Our Magical Log Extractor\n",
    "\n",
    "Behold, the heart of our log extraction sorcery - the `LogExtractionApp<T>` class! This mystical construct builds upon the foundation laid by the `ConsoleApp` class, adding our specific log extraction enchantments.\n",

    "public class LogExtractionApp<T> : ConsoleApp\n",
    "{\n",
    "    // ... (full code omitted for brevity)\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's unravel the secrets of this magical class:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 🧬 **Generic Magic**: The `<T>` in our class name indicates that this is a generic class. It can work with different types of log schemas, making it highly adaptable!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. 🔮 **JsonTranslator**: Our magical translator, capable of converting unstructured logs into structured JSON:\n",
    "   ```csharp\n",
    "   JsonTranslator<T> _translator;\n",
    "   ```\n",

    "   public static LogExtractionApp<T> CreateInstance()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. 🧠 **AI Configuration**: In the constructor, we set up our AI language model:\n",
    "   ```csharp\n",
    "   _translator = new JsonTranslator<T>(\n",
    "       new LanguageModel(new (){\n",

    "       })\n",
    "   );\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   🚨 **Note**: Remember to keep your API key secret in a real application!\n",
    "\n",
    "5. 📜 **Schema Access**: A property to access the TypeSchema of our translator:\n",
    "   ```csharp\n",
    "   public TypeSchema Schema => _translator.Validator.Schema;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. 🎭 **Input Processing**: The core of our log extraction magic:\n",
    "   ```csharp\n",
    "   public override async Task<string> ProcessInputAsync(string input, CancellationToken cancelToken)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This method:\n",
    "   - Sets up the context for log extraction\n",
    "   - Translates the input using our AI model\n",
    "   - Converts the result to a JSON string\n",
    "\n",
    "7. 🔍 **Extraction Prompt**: We provide a clear instruction to our AI:\n",
    "   ```csharp\n",
    "   new PromptSection(\"Extract each log entry from the provided unstructured logs.\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "This `LogExtractionApp<T>` class is where the real magic happens. It takes unstructured logs as input and, through the power of AI and our predefined schema, transforms them into structured, easily analyzable data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, young sorcerer, the power of this class lies in its flexibility. By changing the generic type `T`, we can adapt it to extract different types of logs with ease. Use it wisely, and may your logs always be structured and your insights plentiful! 🧙‍♂️📊✨"

    "1. 🧙‍♂️ **Summoning Our Magical Tool**:\n",
    "   ```csharp\n",
    "   var app = LogExtractionApp<AppLogSchema>.CreateInstance();\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Here, we're creating an instance of our `LogExtractionApp`, specifying `AppLogSchema` as the type of log structure we'll be working with.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. 📜 **The Mystical Scroll of Logs**:\n",
    "   ```csharp\n",
    "   var appLogs = \"\"\"\n",
    "       // ... (a long string of unstructured log data)\n",
    "   \"\"\";\n",
    "   ```\n",

    "   var logs = await app.RunAsync(\"🧠 > Thinking ...\", appLogs);\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   We invoke our app's `RunAsync` method, passing in a thinking emoji as a console prompt and our unstructured logs. This is where the real magic happens - our AI familiar will process these logs and extract structured information.\n",

    "Remember, young sorcerer, the true power of magic lies not just in its creation, but in its application. With this tool, you now have the ability to bring order to the chaos of log data, unlocking insights that were once hidden in the noise.
