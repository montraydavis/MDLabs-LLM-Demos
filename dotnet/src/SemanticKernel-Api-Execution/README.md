# Twitter API Mock Project Overview

## Introduction
This project implements a mock version of the Twitter API using Microsoft's Semantic Kernel. It demonstrates how to create a natural language interface for interacting with a simulated Twitter-like service, showcasing the power of AI-driven API interactions.

## Dependencies
- Microsoft.SemanticKernel (version 1.17.1)
- .NET (8.0)

## Project Components
1. **MockTwitterData**: A class that simulates Twitter data storage with users and tweets.
2. **TwitterApiV2Mock**: The main class that implements mock Twitter API endpoints.
3. **Custom Invocation Filter**: `TwitterApiV2MockFunctionFilter` for processing function invocations.
4. **Semantic Kernel Integration**: Utilizes OpenAI's GPT model for natural language processing.

## Key Features
- Mock implementation of core Twitter functionalities (user management, tweeting, likes, retweets, etc.)
- Natural language interface for API interactions
- Custom response formatting and documentation generation

## Project Goals
1. Demonstrate the capabilities of Microsoft's Semantic Kernel
2. Showcase how AI can be used to create natural language interfaces for APIs
3. Provide a sandbox environment for testing and development without accessing the real Twitter API

## Implementation Highlights
- Use of primary constructors for data models (User and Tweet classes)
- Implementation of various Twitter API endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE operations)
- Custom function invocation filter for response formatting
- Integration with OpenAI's GPT model for natural language understanding

## Usage
The notebook demonstrates various API interactions using natural language prompts, such as:
- User profile retrieval and management
- Tweet creation, retrieval, and deletion
- Liking and retweeting functionality
- Searching for tweets

## Future Enhancements
- Expand the mock API to cover more Twitter functionalities
- Implement more sophisticated natural language processing
- Add authentication and rate limiting to more closely simulate the real Twitter API

## Notes
- This is a mock implementation and does not interact with the real Twitter API
- The project uses simulated data and may not reflect real-world Twitter behavior accurately

By leveraging the Semantic Kernel and natural language processing, this project demonstrates an innovative approach to API interaction, potentially simplifying how developers and users engage with complex services like Twitter.
